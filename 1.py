# This code snippet is iterating over a list named `list` containing the elements "geeks", "for", and
# "geeks".
# in this the len(list) is 3 and for loop works 3 time and print list[index]
# list = ["geeks", "for", "geeks"]
# print(len(list))
# for index in range(len(list)):
#     print(list[index])
# for i in range(0,5):
#     print(i)
# else:
#     print('hello')
